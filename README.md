# SeeSaw

You hate missing out on seeing films that sound amazing but also hate beginning to watch a film before realising that you have already seen it! What you need is a film tracking app so you track the films you want to see and that you have seen.

This film tracking app allows the user to store films that they want to see, including a release date and genre, but also has an archive in order to keep track of films that they have seen as well, along with the users rating of that films. This serves as a useful archive and recommendation tool but also easily places the unseen films in another section once they have been watched.
